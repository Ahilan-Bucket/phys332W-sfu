    "## Overview: What Good Laboratory Performance Means\n",
    "\n",
    "Good laboratory performance means that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You **use your time in the lab effectively** by coming well-prepared to class, working diligently, and thinking about what you are doing\n",
    "- You **spend time outside of the lab** to complete data analysis and do further reading\n",
    "- You **obtain high quality data and results** from your experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assess your laboratory performance through observation, interviews, and examination of your laboratory notebook, analysis and data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "| # | Principle | Description |\n",
    "|---|-----------|-------------|\n",
    "| 1 | **Rotating Authorship** | One person per lab can write the notebook. Must rotate between partners. |\n",
    "| 2 | **Be a Crow** | Write what you predict before you measure. Document expectations. |\n",
    "| 3 | **1-Sigma Uncertainties** | Always quote uncertainties as 1-sigma values and explicitly state this. Do not use confidence intervals. |\n",
    "| 4 | **Use Contours** | Use contours in the notebook. Document methods used in the analysis. |\n",
    "| 5 | **Show Improvements** | Document iterative improvements to technique, setup, and understanding. |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fundamental Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Rule #1** — If it is not written down, it did not happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Rule #2** — Take data and then analyze it! (Do not wait until the end of the lab rotation to analyze your data).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Guidelines for Notebooks and Data Management\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Evolution from Lab Notebook to Data Management\n",
    "\n",
    "For centuries the primary record of any scientific activity was the bound paper notebook. Now, we rely so heavily on computers to acquire, analyze and report scientific data that a paper notebook is rarely enough to keep everything straight. The typical researcher no longer focuses exclusively on maintaining a good lab notebook, but on **good data management**. And while no system for managing scientific data is universally accepted, the basic goal of data management has not changed:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **We need to record all of the information necessary to reproduce what we accomplish in the lab.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Most research labs will have their own set of procedures. Here is a link to an [example](https://harmslab.uoregon.edu/wiki/harms-lab-protocols/data-management/) used by the Harms Lab at University of Oregon.\n"

    "---\n",
    "There are a few items to pay attention to in your lab books:\n",
    "\n",
    "Please clearly label and date not only each in-lab session, but also all work done between lab periods (prelabs, calculations, planning, analysis). Keep entries in chronological order.\n",
    "\n",
    "For analysis, any sample code output (e.g., a PDF export of a Python notebook) should be appended at the end. However, essential plots/results should be included in the flow of the lab book itself, with brief annotations explaining what they show.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please clearly box or otherwise highlight main conclusions as you proceed through the lab book so they are easy to identify.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lab Notebook Content\n",
    "\n",
    "Your lab notebook should be a record of the work you do on the experiment, including **preparation**, **experimental work**, and **analysis**. Think of it as a workplace journal where you record information about what you measured, how you measured it and why, and what things you did to improve your measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Required Details\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to include details such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Date, names, what aspect of the lab you are working on\n",
    "- [ ] Equations that you use\n",
    "- [ ] Sketches and photos of apparatus\n",
    "- [ ] Lists of equipment\n",
    "- [ ] Location of files\n",
    "- [ ] Rough plots and final plots\n",
    "- [ ] Things that worked and things that did not\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- It should be an **up to date** account of what you are working on\n",
    "- You do **not** need to go back and improve things or add things—just start a new section with a date and topic\n",
    "- We do not expect extended essays in your lab notebook\n",
    "- We expect your notes to be **comprehensive enough** that:\n",
    "  - You could use them months later when writing up your project\n",
    "  - Another student could use them to figure out what you had done so that they could replicate your results\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assessment Focus: Reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "In our assessment, we will focus on **reproducibility**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How well could your experiment be reproduced by another student based on your lab notebook?\n",
    "- Would they be able to find all the data?\n",
    "- Would they understand how you set up your apparatus or analyzed your data?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Paper vs. Electronic\n",
    "\n",
    "Paper still has many advantages over computerized documentation: it is fast, cheap, flexible, and durable. Unless you have already established a practice of taking notes electronically, use a **bound laboratory notebook** where the pages are numbered. If you use an electronic method, make sure that you can export the contents to a PDF for assessment (and archiving, if you are using it in a research context).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scanner\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use a paper notebook you will need to use a digital scanner to convert it to an electronic format. The library has several printer/copier/scanner machines available for student use, and there are a variety of scanner apps available for tablets and smartphones.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Managing Data and Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Each group should create its own shared file space on Canvas. Store all of your data and analysis files here so that you, other group members, and your instructors have access to it. (Even if doing an experiment on your own, you should follow these guidelines.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### File Formats\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the file formats that you will use for your data and analysis. For your formal report in LaTeX, all imported figures are easiest to handle if converted to [PDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) files. You should figure out how to do this on your computer (e.g., by printing or exporting to PDF).\n",
    "\n",
    "For long-term storage, **non-proprietary formats** may be more stable:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Data Type | Recommended Format |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------------|\n",
    "| Simple tabular data | [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) (comma separated value) |\n",
    "| Images | [PNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics) or [JPEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG) |\n",
    "| Vector graphics (with text) | [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analysis Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "- Organize your data analysis in a computer script and upload it to your Canvas group file space\n",
    "- Update it as you develop it\n",
    "- Be sure to include any information that would be necessary to reproduce plots that you include in your notebook\n",
    "- This may be a script, or just a copy of the commands that you used to produce it\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Organizing Your File Space\n",
    "\n",
    "Please organize your directory and name your files according to the following template.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the top directory for each experiment you should include a **README file** that briefly summarizes the other files in the directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<ExperimentNameA>/              # top directory for the experiment\n",
    "├── README.txt                  # Readme file\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### README Files\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of a readme file is to record **metadata** about a set of files and folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why README Files Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine doing an experiment, and recording data, notes, and analysis files into some top level folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "MyFantasticLab/\n",
    "├── Analysis/\n",
    "├── Data/\n",
    "└── Notes/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What if you were then to send this information to a collaborator, as a zipped file, with name `<LabName>_<YourName>.zip`. That collaborator, being unorganized, decides to save the file as `downloaded_file.zip` and then forgets about it for a few weeks. When they come back and try to understand the contents of that `downloaded_file.zip`, they will have almost certainly forgotten the context of the data. Worse, they might even forget who sent the data, and think that they created this and therefore own the rights to the data!\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to help prevent this kind of confusion is to **include a README file in every project top-level directory**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### README Template\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact format of the file is up to you, but the goal is always the same—to convey as much information as possible about the data you are storing in the files.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<Project Name>\n",
    "<Project Description>\n",
    "<Project Purpose>\n",
    "<Date when project was started/completed>\n",
    "\n",
    "Names of collaborators:\n",
    "- <Name 1>\n",
    "- <Name 2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements (if there are specific things needed to re-create the analysis):\n",
    "- Python 3.6\n",
    "- Jupyter lab (syzygy)\n",
    "- SciPy <version>\n",
    "- <Name of obscure analysis package and where to get it from>\n",
    "\n",
    "Important files:\n",
    "- <filename 1>: <Description of why this file is particularly important>\n",
    "- speed_of_sound_2019-03-19.csv: Final dataset for the speed of sound of air. \n",
    "  The lab temperature was 20.3 C during data collection.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thinking Long Term\n",
    "\n",
    "In a research context, it is common to need access to data and notes that were acquired years earlier. You probably will not need your records for this course after the term is over, but we will assess you as if you did.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write clearly and legibly\n",
    "- Organize your electronic files well\n",
    "- Use electronic file formats that you know you will be able to read ten years from now\n",
    "- Make sure to capture all of the information necessary to reproduce your experiment\n",
    "- **Back up anything that is in electronic format!** Electronic files are notoriously ephemeral\n",
    "\n",
    "> Just ask [this Melbourne man](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-17/bitcoin-stored-on-hard-drive-lost-when-sent-to-a-tip/9335490) who had a digital wallet with the keys to thousands of Bitcoins stored on a thumb drive that became corrupted. Had he kept better backups, he could have sold these at the end of 2017 for more than $10M.\n",
