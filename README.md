## Git LFS Setup

This repo uses [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to store large files (`.avi` videos). Before cloning or pushing, you must install Git LFS:

1. Download and install Git LFS from https://git-lfs.github.com/
2. Run `git lfs install` (one-time setup per machine)

After that, `git clone`, `git pull`, and `git push` will handle `.avi` files automatically.
